# Console Project

 This project was developed by Revi Studios. It's a custom terminal with commands like *store*, *install* and *cal*.

 
## How to use it

To install the app:
1.  Find the right [release](https://github.com/Revi-Studios/Console-app/releases)

## What I learned

I have learned more javascript. I have also used Gemini 2.0 Flash with it's Canvas mode which indeed was amazing.


## Future plans

I don't plan on updating this project a lot since it has commands to install custom commands. The project was fun to develop and I hope people will like our work.
