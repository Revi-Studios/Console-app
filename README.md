 The Console project was developed by the organization "Revi Studios". It functions like a custom terminal with commands like "store", "install" and "cal"

```



## What I learned

I have learned more javascript. I have also used Gemini 2.0 Flash with it's Canvas mode which indeed was amazing.


## Future plans

I don't plan on updating this project a lot since it has commands to install custom commands. The project was fun to develop and I hope people will like our work.
