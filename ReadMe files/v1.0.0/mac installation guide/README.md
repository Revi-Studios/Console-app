## More Information

### Warning popups 

- For a Mac application to be opened normaly (without a warning message), the application has to be code signed with a paid apple developer account. Checkout these links for more information:
https://tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/
https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/


### Some problems you might face

- On older systems the settings might look a bit different. Try finding security if you can't find "Privacy & Security"

- If opening the app from the first place, doesn't work. Try toggling the "Allow applications from" to "App Store & Known Developers" under: `System Settings > View > Privacy & Security`

### Open-Source:

- This project is open-source, meaning it's code is "open". Everyone can look at it and run it for them selves. This means it's secure to use. If you don't trust the realesed built ready-to-use version you can download the source-code and build it for your selves. You'll find a guide on that on the main page for the project.

### Tools Used For The Project:
- The application was built using Tauri (v2) in Visual Studio Code (vscode).
